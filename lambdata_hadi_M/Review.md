## Compliments:
(1) Great outside the box thinking about the different types of things that can be created via classes or functions.
Choosing an image is not what most people would have thought of, the complexity is a testament to your skill level
and thought process.

(2) Great use cases for the different classes and functions; I can see the everyday use cases where I could apply any
of these classes or functions.

## Constructive Criticisms:
(1) I suggest adding a docstring and commenting out code where you feel it's easiest to get lost when going back over
the code and rereading it.
